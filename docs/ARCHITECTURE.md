# Architecture

Sufni.App is a cross-platform application for analyzing mountain bike suspension telemetry. It acquires raw sensor data from a Pico-based DAQ device (via USB or WiFi), processes it through a signal analysis pipeline, and presents interactive plots for tuning suspension spring rates and damper settings. It also models bike linkage kinematics to compute leverage ratios and related characteristics. The app runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS using Avalonia UI, and supports desktop-to-mobile synchronization.

This document is the catalog. Each subsystem is summarized here and the deep details live in `architecture/`.

The presentation layer holds only UI state and binds against the application layer. Coordinators are the only writers to stores; queries are stateless cross-entity reads; services and factories own infrastructure creation and background execution; view models do not depend on other feature view models for business answers, do not construct concrete datastore implementations, and do not manage picker or thread lifetime — see [UI Architecture](#ui-architecture) for the rules.

## Data Acquisition & File Format

Telemetry reaches the app through three `ITelemetryDataStore` implementations behind a single interface, and SST files come in two binary versions (V3 fixed-record, V4 TLV with IMU/GPS/markers). Parsing applies multi-stage spike elimination before handing samples to the processing pipeline.

- [Data Acquisition](architecture/acquisition.md#data-acquisition) — overview and source-flow diagram
  - [Interfaces](architecture/acquisition.md#interfaces) — `ITelemetryDataStore`, `ITelemetryFile`, `ITelemetryDataStoreService`

## Signal Processing & Suspension Kinematics

`TelemetryData.FromRecording()` orchestrates the full pipeline: travel calibration → Savitzky-Golay velocity → stroke detection → categorization → airtime detection → histogram + statistics. The `Sufni.Kinematics` library independently solves bike linkage geometry to derive leverage ratios. Sensor calibration is a strategy-pattern bridge between raw ADC counts and millimeters of travel.

  - [Travel Calculation](architecture/processing.md#travel-calculation) — sensor-driven mm conversion

## UI Architecture

The presentation layer is layered `Views → ViewModels → Coordinators / Stores / Queries → Services → Platform`. Stores own shared read state (read interface for VMs, writer interface for coordinators); coordinators own all workflows, store writes, post-save navigation, and sync arrival; queries answer cross-domain business questions; view models project state to bindings and route commands. ScottPlot rendering helpers live alongside the rest of the UI.

## Live DAQ Streaming

The live preview feature streams real-time telemetry from a connected DAQ device to the desktop app over a framed TCP protocol. It is intentionally separate from the import pipeline: it has its own discovery catalog, browse ownership, runtime-only store, and per-tab transport clients. The feature activates only when the user selects the Live primary page, and each detail tab owns an independent connection that disconnects on tab close.

```
mDNS announcement
  -> LiveDaqCatalogService (probe board ID)
    -> LiveDaqCoordinator.Reconcile (merge with known boards)
      -> LiveDaqStore.Upsert
        -> DynamicData -> LiveDaqListViewModel -> UI

User selects row
  -> LiveDaqCoordinator.SelectAsync
    -> shell.OpenOrFocus<LiveDaqDetailViewModel>

Tab loads -> LiveDaqClient.ConnectAsync -> StartPreviewAsync
  -> receive loop parses frames -> LiveDaqSessionState.ApplyFrame
    -> DispatcherTimer tick -> CreateSnapshot -> UI binding

Tab closes -> Unloaded -> DisconnectAsync -> TCP closed
```

## Persistence & Serialization

SQLite via `sqlite-net-pcl` with WAL mode. All sync-enabled entities inherit from `Synchronizable`, carrying `Updated` / `ClientUpdated` / `Deleted` timestamps for soft delete and conflict resolution. Session metadata and the MessagePack telemetry blob are split across separate operations so the blob isn't dragged through metadata-only writes.

Topics in [architecture/persistence.md](architecture/persistence.md):

- [Schema](architecture/persistence.md#schema) — ER diagram for `session`, `bike`, `setup`, `board`, `track`, `session_cache`, `app_setting`, `sync`, `paired_device`
- [Database Service](architecture/persistence.md#database-service) — generic `Synchronizable` operations and session-specific blob ops
- [Soft Delete](architecture/persistence.md#soft-delete) — `Deleted` timestamp, 1-day purge window, expired-pair cleanup
- [Conflict Resolution](architecture/persistence.md#conflict-resolution) — `MergeAsync<T>()` rules: new / remote-delete / local-wins / remote-wins

---

## Cross-Device Synchronization

A desktop instance can host an embedded ASP.NET Core / Kestrel server over TLS with JWT auth, advertised via mDNS. Mobile clients pair with a 6-digit PIN, then push and pull entity changes plus session telemetry blobs. `SyncCoordinator` is the application-layer entry point; `HttpApiService` handles JWT auto-refresh.

Topics in [architecture/sync.md](architecture/sync.md):

- [Pairing Flow](architecture/sync.md#pairing-flow) — request → confirm → refresh sequence
- [Server](architecture/sync.md#server) — `SynchronizationServerService`, TLS / JWT / mDNS setup, full endpoint table
- [Client](architecture/sync.md#client) — `SynchronizationClientService` four-phase sync, `SyncCoordinator`, `HttpApiService` token refresh, `SynchronizationData` payload
